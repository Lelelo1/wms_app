Warehouse management system

An app delevoped by myself with Flutter to a company that interacts with their (Magento) e commerce system. It contains following features:

EAN adding
See product information: name, sku, images, quantity, shelf - (via SKU or by EAN upon scanning)
Adding returned products to warehouse (scan product, then scan shelf qr code)
Assign shelf to a product (popup when product is missing a shelf, answer yes)
See and select customer orders and their product. Check off products.
