An app delevoped by myself with Flutter to a company that interacts with their (Magento) e commerce system. It contains following features:

* EAN adding </br>
* See product information: name, sku, images, quantity, shelf - (via SKU or by EAN upon scanning) </br>
* Adding returned products to warehouse (scan product, then scan shelf qr code) </br>
* Assign shelf to a product (popup when product is missing a shelf, answer yes) </br>
* See and select customer orders and their product. Check off products </br>
